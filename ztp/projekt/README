- Linux
	Go to docker directory and run 'docker-compose up -d'

When all the applications are initialized using selected MongoDB tool import cards.json into 'cah' database, 'card' collection.

Frontend can be then accessed through http://localhost:3000 and backend through localhost:8080

If the application should be accessed by other devices in the network, open docker-compose.yml file from docker directory
and modify HOST_IP environmental variable for both react and spring services and put machine's ip address on the local network.
